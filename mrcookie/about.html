                    <h2>Pai</h2>
                    <p>Pai is the steady foundation of our family and the heart behind the dream of Mr. Cookie becoming a
                        reality. Originally from Brazil, he brings a lot of love, laughter, and flavor into everything we
                        do. He works incredibly hard—behind the scenes and beyond—to support every part of our project, from
                        planning and logistics to cheering us on through every sale. Pai believes deeply in teaching by
                        example, and his dedication shows our kids the value of commitment and perseverance. Without him,
                        Mr. Cookie wouldn't be more than a sweet idea—we're so grateful he's our biggest helper and
                        believer.</p>

                    <h2>Mom: Kane</h2>
                    <p>Hi friends! I'm Daniela, the proud mom behind Mr. Cookie. Baking has always been one of my greatest
                        joys, especially when I get to share it with my family. I’ve loved seeing how my children have
                        inherited this passion and how we’ve grown together through this little business. I usually take the
                        lead in baking (and yes, I happily work for kisses!), but I’m really just part of a beautiful team.
                        More than anything, I want my kids to know that with love, effort, and teamwork, we can build
                        something truly special.</p>

                    <h2>Keto</h2>
                    <p>Keto is our amazing swimmer—fast, focused, and always up for a challenge. Outside the water, he’s 
                        just as dedicated in the kitchen, where he helps measure, mix, and of course, taste-test our cookies.
                        He has a great eye for details and often spots ways we can improve our process. Keto loves working side 
                        by side with his siblings and brings a lot of fun and energy to our team. He’s proof that discipline and
                        sweetness can go hand in hand!</p>

                    <p>Dodo is a bright and creative soul who sees the world in such a unique way. Being neurodiverse is one of 
                        his superpowers—it helps him notice things others might miss. He’s deeply involved in packing the cookies 
                        and always makes sure everything looks just right. Dodo brings joy and warmth to our kitchen, and his 
                        smile lights up every market we attend. We love how he reminds us that everyone has something important 
                        to contribute.</p>

                        with the same passion he brings to the mat. Totti is always ready to help, whether it’s rolling dough or 
                        carefully placing cookies into their packages. He’s also one of our top salespeople and never shies away 
                        from sharing our treats with others. His courage and dedication inspire us every day.</p>

                        kind, and loves experimenting with new cookie ideas and flavors. Cece takes pride in helping with the 
                        packaging and always adds her special touch to make everything feel extra lovely. She has a natural sense 
                        of style and often suggests how we can present things better. Cece reminds us that sweetness comes in many
                        forms—kindness, creativity, and a sprinkle of sparkle.</p>
